# Motivation

This project contains links to my developed shiny apps you might find helpful...For every new interesting idea I have I'll build an app. Some might be basic shiny, others might be complex shiny, depending on how important I think they are. Let me know what you think,suggestions for improvements and new apps are welcome.
